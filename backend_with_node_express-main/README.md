# Node.js Backend Project  

## Introduction  
This is a backend project built using Node.js. It serves as the backbone of an application, handling business logic, database interactions, authentication, and API endpoints.  

## Understanding Backend Development  
Backend development focuses on managing and processing data, ensuring secure communication between clients (e.g., web applications, mobile apps) and databases. Key aspects of backend development include:  

- **Server-Side Logic**: Processes client requests and sends appropriate responses.  
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Provides endpoints for front-end applications or other services to interact with the backend.  
- **Database Management**: Stores, retrieves, and manipulates data efficiently.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensures that users can access only permitted resources.  
- **Middleware**: Functions that process requests before they reach the final handler.  
- **Error Handling**: Manages application errors gracefully to enhance user experience.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.  
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs.  
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL**: Database for storing application data.  
- **Mongoose / Sequelize**: ORM for interacting with the database.  
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure authentication mechanism.  
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.
